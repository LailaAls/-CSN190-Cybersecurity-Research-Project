## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how open-source cybersecurity tools can be used to analyze the security of home and small business networks. Using Nmap, I performed host discovery, service enumeration, and vulnerability detection to understand how exposed a typical network can be. The focus of the project is ethical network scanning, documentation, and learning how attackers and defenders analyze networks.

## Software / Tools Used
- **Nmap** (v7.98)
- **Nmap NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine)**
- macOS Terminal
- Bash shell
- GitHub (documentation & version control)

## Getting Started
To replicate this project:
1. Install Nmap on macOS using Homebrew
2. Identify your local IP address using `ifconfig`
3. Test connectivity using `ping`
4. Discover hosts using `nmap -sn`
5. Enumerate services using `nmap -sV`
6. Identify vulnerabilities using Nmap NSE scripts

Refer to `research-notes/6.3-TUTORIAL.md` for full instructions.

## Results Summary
Through this project, I learned how easily network information can be discovered using freely available tools. I identified active devices, open ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities on my local network using Nmap. This project strengthened my understanding of network security fundamentals and ethical vulnerability assessment.
