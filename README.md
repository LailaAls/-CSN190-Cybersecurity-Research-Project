## Project Overview
This project explores how open-source cybersecurity tools can be used to assess the security of home and small business networks. Using Nmap, I performed host discovery, service enumeration, and vulnerability scanning to understand how attackers and defenders view network exposure. The project emphasizes hands-on learning, documentation, and ethical security testing.

## Getting Started
To replicate this project:
1. Install Nmap on macOS using Homebrew  
2. Identify your local IP address with `ifconfig`  
3. Use Nmap to scan your local network  
4. Analyze services and vulnerabilities ethically  

Refer to `research-notes/6.3-TUTORIAL.md` for step-by-step instructions.

## Results Summary
Through this project, I learned how easily network information can be discovered using freely available tools. I successfully identified active devices, open ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities on my local network. This experience strengthened my understanding of network security fundamentals and defensive testing techniques.
