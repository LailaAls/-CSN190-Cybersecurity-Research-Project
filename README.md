Laila Alsaedi, CSN 190

I’m interested in cybersecurity and want to learn how to protect systems from attacks. My plan is to transfer to a 4 year college, work on getting my Security+ certification and other certification, and gain hands-on experience. I know I still have more to learn, but I’m excited to keep growing my skills.
