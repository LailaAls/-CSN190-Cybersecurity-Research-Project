Over 40% of cyberattacks target small businesses, yet many of them lack advanced security systems or trained IT staff to protect their networks. This makes them highly vulnerable to data breaches, ransomware, and other cyber threats. This project focuses on improving small business network security by using free, open-source tools like Nmap and OpenVAS to identify open ports, vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations. The goal is to create a simple and repeatable process that small business owners or beginner IT workers can follow to check and strengthen their own systems. The project will involve hands-on testing in a small virtual network environment. I will scan different network setups using Nmap to map devices and detect open ports, then use OpenVAS to find known security issues. All results will be documented in a short report explaining what problems were found and how they can be fixed. By completing this project, I expect to gain practical skills in network scanning and vulnerability detection. The main outcome will be a practical guide showing how small businesses can use open-source tools to improve their network security without spending much money.

Self-Evaluation
My abstract includes all five required components: background, problem statement, purpose, methods, and expected results. I started with a clear background about why small business security matters and used a real statistic to show its importance. The problem statement explains that many small businesses lack strong protection, and the purpose describes my goal to create a simple security process using Nmap and OpenVAS. The methods section explains how I will test these tools on a small virtual network, and the expected results focus on building practical skills and a guide for others. The hardest part is keeping the abstract short while still explaining the steps clearly. I think it aligns well with my feasibility analysis because itâ€™s realistic, hands-on, and fits my current skill level.
