# Scanning My Home Network with Nmap: A Beginner’s Journey into Network Security

## 1. Introduction

Many people assume that home networks are safe simply because they are private. Before this project, I believed that having a Wi-Fi password was enough to protect my devices. This assignment challenged that assumption by showing how much information can be gathered using freely available tools.

In this project, I used **Nmap**, a powerful open-source network scanning tool, to analyze my own home network. The goal was to identify active devices, discover open ports, enumerate running services, and detect potential vulnerabilities using Nmap’s scripting engine.

This article documents my hands-on experience performing real-world network reconnaissance as a cybersecurity student. By the end of this article, readers will understand how network scanning works, why exposed services matter, and how even small home networks can introduce security risks if not properly configured.

## 2. Purpose and Background

I chose Nmap because it is one of the most widely used tools in cybersecurity. Penetration testers, system administrators, and security analysts rely on Nmap for discovering hosts, identifying services, and detecting vulnerabilities.

The main problem Nmap helps solve is visibility. Organizations and individuals cannot secure what they do not know exists. Through this project, I wanted to understand how attackers might view a network from the outside and how defenders can use the same tools to identify weaknesses before they are exploited.

At first, I expected to find minimal information. However, once scanning began, I realized how much data can be revealed without logging into any device. This experience highlighted the importance of proactive security testing and reinforced why reconnaissance is often the first stage of a cyberattack.

## 3. Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- macOS
- Terminal access
- Nmap version 7.98 or later
- Administrative (sudo) privileges
- Permission to scan the network

### Installing Nmap
```bash
brew install nmap


4. Using the Software: Step-by-Step Walkthrough
Step 1: Identify Local IP Address
ifconfig
From the output, I identified my local IP address:
inet 192.168.1.87

Step 2: Test Network Connectivity
ping 192.168.1.1
This confirmed that my router was reachable and responding to requests.

Step 3: Discover Active Hosts
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
This scan identified active devices on my network, including my router, laptop, and mobile devices.

Step 4: Scan My Own Device
nmap 192.168.1.87
All scanned ports were closed, meaning no unnecessary services were exposed on my system.

Step 5: Service and Version Detection
nmap -sV 192.168.1.1
This scan revealed services such as HTTP, HTTPS, and UPnP running on the router.

Step 6: Vulnerability Scanning with NSE
sudo nmap -sV --script vuln 192.168.1.1
The scan reported:
Slowloris Denial-of-Service (CVE-2007-6750) – Likely Vulnerable
HTTP Method Tampering – Authentication bypass risk

5. Research Insights

According to OWASP documentation, improper handling of HTTP methods can allow attackers to bypass authentication controls. This directly relates to the HTTP method tampering vulnerability identified during scanning.

Additionally, Slowloris remains an effective denial-of-service technique against misconfigured web servers. Research confirms that many embedded devices and routers still lack proper protections against such attacks, reinforcing the importance of regular vulnerability assessments.

6. Challenges and Problem-Solving

One challenge I encountered was NSE script execution errors. Some scripts failed during initial runs. After troubleshooting, I learned that running Nmap with sudo was required for certain scripts to function correctly.

Another challenge involved interpreting filtered ports. Through research, I learned that filtered ports often indicate firewall protections rather than vulnerabilities, highlighting the importance of understanding scan results rather than assuming all findings are security issues.

7. Expected Results

If performed correctly, this project should result in:

Identification of the local IP address

Successful ping responses

Discovery of active hosts

Enumeration of open ports and services

Detection of at least one potential vulnerability

These results demonstrate how reconnaissance reveals a network’s exposure.

8. Conclusion and Future Applications

This project provided valuable hands-on experience with real-world network scanning techniques. I learned how attackers gather information and how defenders can use the same tools to strengthen security.

In the future, I plan to expand this work by analyzing traffic with Wireshark, exploring additional Nmap scripts, and testing other network devices. This experience strengthened my technical skills, troubleshooting ability, and documentation practices, all of which are essential in cybersecurity roles.
