- Final Topic Choice: Small Business Network Security
I decided to go with Small Business Network Security for my final topic. I think this topic is more
beginner-friendly and something I can actually test and understand. Tools like Nmap and
OpenVAS help find weak spots in a network, which is important for small businesses that don’t
have big IT teams. I already have a little experience from my CSN 150 class, where I learned
how to use Nmap to scan networks and find open ports. This project will let me build on that
experience while learning more about network safety and testing.
This topic feels realistic because I can download and try the tools myself. Setting them up might
take some work, but there are plenty of tutorials online to help. It’s also easier to see real results
— I can scan a small test network and see what it finds. I like that this connects to real-world
problems and helps protect people and businesses from hackers. That makes it both useful and
interesting to me.
My goals:
● Ambitious Goal: Build a small network and use OpenVAS and Nmap to find and fix
security issues.
● Realistic Target: Learn how to scan safely and write a report about what I found.
● Minimum Outcome: Show that I can use at least one tool (like Nmap) and explain how it
helps small businesses stay safe.
By doing this project, I’ll learn more about network security, scanning tools, and how to
understand scan results. Even if I don’t finish everything, I’ll still gain hands-on skills that are
useful for IT or cybersecurity. That’s why I think this topic is the best choice for me.










● Passion Level: Moderate — interesting but more complex for a beginner
