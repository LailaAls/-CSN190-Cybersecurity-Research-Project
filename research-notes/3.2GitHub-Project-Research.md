- Comparison Notes

- Topic 1 (Networks):

- OpenVAS does full scans but is harder to use.

- Nmap is simpler and faster but can show too much info.

- Together, they help small businesses keep networks safe.

### Topic 2 (AI Safety):

- Guardrails keeps AI from saying bad or unsafe things.

- ART checks if AI can be fooled by hackers.

- Guardrails is easier for companies, ART is better for research.

- Questions I Thought Of

- For Networks:

- Which tool is best for beginners, OpenVAS or Nmap?

- Can small businesses use both tools together?

- What if a small business has no IT staff—can they still use these?

- For AI Safety:

- Can non-experts use Guardrails or ART easily?

Will companies need “AI safety officers” in the future?

How do we test if AI safety tools are really working?
